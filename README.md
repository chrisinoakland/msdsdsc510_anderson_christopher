## Python

### Repo Description:

This repo is primarily to display the use of the Python programming language as a tool to clean, slice, and build tools to analyze existing datasets.

### Objectives:

1. Demonstrate fundamental principles of programming, including data types, variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and objects.
2. Compose Python data wrangling and analysis programs by combining custom developed code with modules from Python's built-in libraries and from modules maintained by third parties.
3. Create a user-defined, reusable Python module using classes, functions, and professional programming practices.
4. Demonstrate basic Python and programming literacy by interpreting and commenting on Python code written by others.
5. Make use of Python community programming best practices by following recommended naming conventions and style considerations.

### Files:

1. weatherApp.py - An application that prompts the user for a city or zip code and requests a weather report or forecast - based upon the user's selection - from OpenWeatherMap.
2. cableReceipt3.py - A program to calculate the total installation costs of fiber optic cable and print a receipt after gathering inputs.
3. mathProgram.py - This program will have a main section which contains a while loop. The while loop will be used to allow the user to run the program until they enter a value which ends the loop.
