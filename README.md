Course Description:

This course introduces the Python programming language as a tool to clean, slice, and build tools to analyze an existing dataset. Basic principles of programming are explored as well as techniques for configuring a computer for data science work.

Course Objectives:

1. Demonstrate fundamental principles of programming, including data types, variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and objects.
2. Compose Python data wrangling and analysis programs by combining custom developed code with modules from Python's built-in libraries and from modules maintained by third parties.
3. Create a user-defined, reusable Python module using classes, functions, and professional programming practices.
4. Demonstrate basic Python and programming literacy by interpreting and commenting on Python code written by others.
5. Make use of Python community programming best practices by following recommended naming conventions and style considerations.
